# Risk Management
This repository is for a quantitative risk management class I take, in which we cover the following topics.

<pre>
Week02 Multivariate Statistics, Regression Models
 • The basics
 • OLS regression
 • Maximum Likelihood Estimation
 • Evaluation metrics
 • AR and MA processes

Week03 Multivariate Normal Monte Carlo
 • Cholesky factorization
 • Dealing with non-PSD matrics
 • Exponentially weighted covariance
 • Multivariate Normal simulation from a covariance matrix
 • Multivariate Normal simulation using PCA

Week04 Value at Risk
 • Delta Normal VaR (parametric VaR)
 • Normal Monte Carlo VaR
 • Historical VaR
 • VaR calculation assuming different distributions
 • Classical Brownian, arithmetic return, Geometric Brownian

Week05 Advanced VaR and Expected Shortfall
 • Expected Shortfall
 • Model based simulation (vs. distribution based)
 • Copulas and Gaussian Copula simulation

Week06 Options
Week07 Options and Portfolio Construction
Week08 Attribution and Risk Parity

Each week's folder includes a PDF file and a Jupyter notebook. The PDF describes the problems I try to solve, my thought processes, implementation details, results, and main takeaways. The Jupyter notebook shows the code I wrote for solving the problems.
